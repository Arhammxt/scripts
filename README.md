# My Personal Compiler & Environment Scripts

This is only some repository that provide my compiler script for android and other my environment script.
I'll update it when i need it, you can use my script if you want it (if this scripts suit for your needs).
Just adjust ALIAS to yourself environment directories in script folder. And you're safe to use.

I'm not provide any guide to you if want to use this script, cause this is not really a complex scripts.
Just install common component for compiling kernel (include ccache) and you can use it.
