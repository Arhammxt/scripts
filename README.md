# My Personal Compiler & Environment Scripts for Android Kernel

This is my personal tool scripts for compiling android kernel with several bunch of specific environment, that already
set for specific device and specific machine to use (CI / VPS), just configure by yourself if you want to use it, it's
all on <b>env</b> folder.

I'm not provide any guide to you if want to use this script, cause this is not really a complex scripts.
Just install common component for compiling kernel (include ccache) and you're safe to use it.
